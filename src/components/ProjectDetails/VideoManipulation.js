          Developed a video manipulation application using Python, Pygame,
          Numpy, and OpenCV.
        </li>
        <li>
          Implemented various video manipulation techniques such as black and

          with n-level color bit pixels.
        </li>
        <li>
          Utilized Pygame for video loading and display, Numpy for efficient
          data manipulation, and OpenCV for image processing operations.
        </li>
        <li>
          Incorporated the functionality to capture screenshots by pressing the
