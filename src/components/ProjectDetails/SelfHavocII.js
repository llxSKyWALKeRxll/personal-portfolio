        <li>
          Developed Self Havoc-II, a 3D-based third person game using Java and
          OpenGL.
        </li>
        <li>
          Implemented various core concepts of object-oriented programming to
          create a realistic game environment.
        </li>
        <li>
          Utilized shaders such as fragment shader, vertex shader, and terrain
          shader to enhance the visual effects of the game.
        </li>
        <li>
          Incorporated features like realistic fog, height-map terrain,
          object-collision detection, and player control through keyboard and
          mouse input.
        </li>
        <li>
          Implemented phong lighting, including per-pixel lighting, specular
          lighting, and diffuse lighting, to enhance the visual quality of the
          game.
        </li>
        <li>
          Applied multi-texturing and mip-mapping techniques to optimize
          performance and improve texture rendering.
